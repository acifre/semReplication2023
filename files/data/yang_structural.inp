DATA: 
    ! This is a comment
  FILE IS "cov_matrix.csv";
    ! You can also specify a complete path to the directory that contains the data-file.
  TYPE IS FULLCOV;
    ! Mplus can read many different "TYPE"s of data.
    ! Find the chapter and section with the description
  NOBSERVATIONS = 332;
 
VARIABLE:
  NAMES ARE AP, APAE, AD, IG, DSQ, US, FT, SD, HC, AX, ST, DM; 
  ! NAMES are the variables incldued in the DATA FILE above.
  USEVARIABLES ARE AP, APAE, AD, IG, DSQ, US, FT, SD, HC, AX, ST, DM;
  ! USEVARIABLES allows you to EXCLUDE variables from analysis.

ANALYSIS:
    ! Mplus allows MANY different types of analysis
    ! Skim through the chapter with descriptions of various analyses 
    ! PAY particular attention to available Estimators, Options and Restrictions
  TYPE IS GENERAL;
  ESTIMATOR IS ML;

MODEL:
! This section should include SEMScript with ALL its nuances.
! 1. Always specify the measurement model first.
! 2. First factor-loading for each LV is fixed to 1.0 to set the scale
! 3. ONE line per parameter
! 4. Mind the punctuation (semi-colon)
! 5. ALWAYS use a parameter-label. Must correspond to the label in the path-diagram
